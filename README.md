MinimalisticTelnet
==================
Very small updates made to mewiii's library to include support for enabling Cisco routers, matching the device prompt and trimming null characters seen in Some Cisco Nexus devices

Additional modifications made from Jon Sagara's fork of Tom Janssens's minimalistic telnet library which can be found [here](https://github.com/jonsagara/MinimalisticTelnet).  Setter and getter methods were added along with methods for logging into devices that optionally have a Username: prompt or require pressing a key before entering the password (such as on HP switches).

Slight modifications to Tom Janssens's excellent minimalistic telnet library, which you can find at [The Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19071/Quick-tool-A-minimalistic-Telnet-library).
